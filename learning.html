      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Orbit dynamics are made up of complicated information that help us understand how objects 
        move while in space. This information is comprised of mathematical equations and scientific theory 
        that have been developed and study over centuries. The goal of this website is to help provide
        a basic understanding of some of the fundamental concepts of these equations and theories for anybody 
        to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website currently focuses on how the theory behind three different orbit models: the two-body problem, 
        the three-body problem, and relative motion. Each of these models help scientists and engineers 
        understand how an object moves in space depending on the desired conditions. The two-body problem focuses on 
        how two objects in space interact with each other, such as a planet and a satellite. The three-body problem 
        adds a third object to the two-body problem, which greatly increases the completexity of the system. Examples 
        of the three-body problem include a system made of the Earth, Moon, and a satellite. Finally, relative motion 
        shows how two objects move in relation to each other, such as a satellite constellation for GPS navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each section of this website includes the theory and equations that were used to plot each type of orbit model on the main page. 
        The resources page includes textbooks and online resources that were utilized in the making of this website. 
        It is recommend to use these resources to study these topics further if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, remember that these topics are studied by scientists for their entire lives so never feel discouraged while 
        trying to learn these topics. Never feel afraid to reach out for help. Good luck on your learning journey!
